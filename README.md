A pipeline project for the SNP&SEQ platform built on top of GATK Queue.

Run setup.sh to download and compile dependencies (later version will hopefully be able to use managed dependencies for this).

Look in the dna-pipeline.sh and rna-pipeline.sh to configure and run the actual pipelines. And in the globalConfig.sh to see global options (and initiating debug mode etc).
